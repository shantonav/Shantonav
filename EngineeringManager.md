# My principles for a good and performing team
 - No finger in a hand is the same, so teams would be heterogenous  
 - Never to be scared to do and always learn from mistakes (not to repeat them ofcourse is the 1st lerning)  
 - Mutual respect for each other : VERY IMPORTANT
 - Walk out of difficult discussions with something positive. (if possible with a glass of beer) 
 - keep on learning and be aware
 - We succeed and fail together , no point in blaming.
 - Listen , be patient and open to alternative ideas.
